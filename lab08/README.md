Question 1: What are the denominations of the US coins from the green,
blue and orange distributions? Can you think why the coins from the same
denomination might show variation in weight although they are specified to
be of the same weight? If your vending machine had a weight sensor, how
would you use the weight of a coin that was just inserted to find the
denomination?

	The green section represents Pennies, which weigh about 2.5g,
	The blue section represents Nickels, which weigh about 5.0g
	and the orange section represents Dollar coins, which weigh about 8.1g
	
	Every single coin cannot be perfectly in tact, as minting variations,
	over time rubbing/breaking off material, or even residue at the sub-
	gram level, will cause the physical coin from being exactly its nominal
	value.

	If I was using a weight sensor to determine the coin denomination
	PER COIN, I take the existing data of current nominal values for each
	denomination and match the weighted coin to the closest group. 

Question 2. We can shine light on the coin and measure the reflected
amount of light which should be proportional (directly or in some non-linear
way) to the size/area of the coin. Can you guess which sensor on the
Grove Pi Kit can be used for this purpose?

	We could use the light sensor/photoresistor on the GrovePi Kit.
	
Question 3: Which of the following datasets are linearly separable? Justify
your answer.

	Dataset A provides clearly seperatable data points with zero
	intersecting points, a linear/straight line can be drawn between
	the two states that accurately isolate the two types of data points
	on each side.

Question 4. Sometimes we need more than a simple hyperplane to
separate the datasets of the two classes. What are some other simple
geometric entities other than a simple plane/line that can be used to
separate some of the data points that were not linearly separable?

	These equations are for circles, conic intersections, parabolas,
	eclipses, and hyperbolas.

Question 5. For the example shown in the figure, what is approximately the
output of the neuron?
the bias is -2[if anybody has any confusion]

	
	The final output neuron would be 0.982
